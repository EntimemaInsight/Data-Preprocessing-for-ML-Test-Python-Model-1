# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the important steps of data preprocessing, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, to prepare the data for machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase the data preprocessing steps required before applying machine learning algorithms to a given dataset. The key steps covered in this project are:

1. Importing the required libraries
2. Handling missing data with imputation
3. Encoding categorical data
4. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
5. Feature scaling for improved model performance

## Getting Started
To run the code provided in this project, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Matplotlib
3. Pandas
4. Sklearn 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repository

3. Open the project files in your preferred Python IDE or editor.

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries at the beginning of your Python script:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

2. Import the dataset using the pd.read_csv() function. Adjust the file path to match the location of your dataset:
data = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv")
3. Follow the code provided in the project to preprocess your dataset. Each step is clearly marked with comments to explain its purpose.
4. Customize the code as per your specific dataset and requirements.
5. Run the Python script to see the output and results of each preprocessing step.
